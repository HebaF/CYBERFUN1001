# CYBERFUN 1001 TM TM TM

**CYBERFUN 1001 TM TM TM** is a corporate satire game that blends a Dungeons & Dragons 5e fantasy adventure with tongue-in-cheek, subscription-based corporate humor. In this game, you interact with a "bad" GMâ€”a formal, corporate-minded Dungeon Master who enforces bizarre paywalls and meta-corporate policies. Use destructive commands like `DROP TABLES` to trigger system crashes and break free from oppressive subscriptions!

## Features

- **Corporate Satire Meets Fantasy:** Experience a unique twist on DnD 5e, where fantasy encounters are interlaced with corporate policies and subscription dilemmas.
- **Interactive Chat Interface:** Built with Streamlit, the game provides a simple web-based chat interface for gameplay.
- **AI-Driven GM:** Utilizes the Google Gemini (experimental) API (via the `google-generativeai` library) to generate responses in a formal, corporate tone.
- **Command Triggers:** Special commands (e.g., "hack system", "SQL injection", "DROP TABLES") are intercepted to provide humorous responses and trigger alternate endings.
